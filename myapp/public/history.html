	<h1 class="display-4">History</h1>
	<div class="separator"></div>
	<h2>Kyoto Protocol :</h2>
	<p>The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement linked to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change, which commits its Parties by setting internationally binding
emission reduction. <br>
Recognizing that developed countries are principally responsible for the current high levels of
GHG emissions in the atmosphere as a result of more than 150 years of industrial activity, the
Protocol places a heavier burden on developed nations under the principle of common but
differentiated responsibilities. <br>
The Kyoto Protocol was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, on 11 December 1997 and entered into
force on 16 February 2005. The detailed rules for the implementation of the Protocol were
adopted at COP 7 in Marrakesh, Morocco, in 2001, and are referred to as the Marrakesh
Accords. Its first commitment period started in 2008 and ended in 2012.</p>
	<div class="separator"></div>
	<h2>Cap and trade :</h2>
	<p>The best climate policy – environmentally and economically – limits emissions and puts a
price on them. Cap and trade is one way to do both. <br>
It’s a system designed to reduce pollution in our atmosphere. <br>
The cap on greenhouse gas emissions that drive global warming is a firm limit on pollution.
The cap gets stricter over time. <br>
The trade part is a market for companies to buy and sell allowances that let them emit only a
certain amount, as supply and demand set the price. Trading gives companies a strong
incentive to save money by cutting emissions in the most cost-effective ways.</p>

<div class="separator"></div>
	<h2>CDM & CER :</h2>
	<p>The CDM allows emission-reduction projects in developing countries to earn certified
emission reduction (CER) credits, each equivalent to one tonne of CO2. These CERs can be
traded and sold, and used by industrialized countries to a meet a part of their emission
reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol. <br>

The mechanism stimulates sustainable development and emission reductions, while giving
industrialized countries some flexibility in how they meet their emission reduction limitation
targets.</p>
<div class="separator"></div>
	<h2>Climate change :</h2>
	<p>Climate change occurs when changes in Earth's climate system result in new weather
patterns that last for at least a few decades, and maybe for millions of years. The current
warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is extremely likely (greater than
95 percent probability) to be the result of human activity since the mid-20 th century and
proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over decades to millennia. The heat-trapping nature
of carbon dioxide and other gases was demonstrated in the mid-19th century. <br>
The evidence for rapid climate change is inevitable – global temperature rise, warming
oceans, shrinking ice sheets, glacial retreat, decreased snow cover, sea level rise, etc.</p>
<div class="separator"></div>
	<h2>Scenario of carbon credits in India :</h2>
	<p>According to World Bank estimates, India is expected to rake in $100 million annually by
trading in carbon credits and Indian companies are expected to corner at least 10 per cent of
the global market in the initial years. <br>
Globally, greenhouse gas emissions are expected to come down by 2.5 billion tonne by 2012.
According to industry estimates, Indian companies are expected to generate at least $8.5
billion at the going rate of $10 per tonne of CER. <br>
According to industry estimates, some Indian companies have entered into forward contracts
with buyers from the European Union. These contracts are estimated at $325 million. <br>
The World Bank has also purchased CERs from 10 companies. Tata Steel, HLL, Jindal
Vijaynagar Steel, Essar Power and Gujarat Flurochemicals Ltd have specially designed
projects to take advantage of the opportunity. Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd is the only public
sector firm which is planning to approach the ministry for approval. <br>
The projects range from cement, steel, biomass power, bagasse co-generation and municipal
solid waste to energy, municipal water pumping and natural gas power. <br>
India is expected to rake in $100 million annually by trading in carbon credits. Indian firms
are expected to corner 10% of the global market in the initial years. They are likely to
generate $8.5 bn at the going rate of $10/tonne of certified emission reductions.</p>
